# BTalk-AutoReply
BitcoinTalk Auto-Reply Script

## What is this?

This script was made for [BitcoinTalk](https://bitcointalk.org/) (an internet forum) in order to make "bumping" (or auto-replying every 24 hours) a much easier process.

## Setup

1. Download the lastest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if needed.

2. To install requirements, navigate to the folder and execute this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Open `config.ini` in a text editor of your choice to configure the settings. _(Use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) if you are having issues)_

## What is a Captcha Code?

Your Captcha Code (or Captcha Bypass Code) is a code that lets you bypass the CAPTCHA on the login page. This is required because the program needs to be automatic, and captcha's can only be completed by humans.

After you login to your account, you may obtain this code [here](https://bitcointalk.org/captcha_code.php)

It should look something like this: 3603681f39b847834842
