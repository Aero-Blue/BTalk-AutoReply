Your Captcha Code (or Captcha Bypass Code) is a code that lets you bypass the CAPTCHA on the login page. This is required because the program needs to be automatic, and captcha's can only be completed by humans.

After you login to your account, you may obtain this code here: https://bitcointalk.org/captcha_code.php
